# cipheringMethods
Create different encryption algorithms in any language.
If there isn't a folder for your language, create one. e.g.:

    Create new file -> cipheringMethods/Java/myAlgorithm.java

Contribute with a valid algorithm, and participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

You can also improve an existing algorithm (providing a decryption method, creating a cli or gui...) It's up to you, but make substancial changes.

**That's it. Happy hacking!**
